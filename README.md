# Hi, I’m Gunter Ansinn

I am a long time self taught programmer who is really interested in constantly expanding my knowledge of code. Including deep dives into miscellaneous projects to expand my general programming knowledge in all directions.

My current project is building a performant game engine within java with as many modules made in java from scratch as possible. Each module is built with the intent of both being a learning experience and a resource for others to learn. My current project is the general image parser: pixelatte.

- I’m interested in:
  - Computer Science
  - Engineering
  - Jazz

- Favorite Language
  - Java

- Can program in
 - Javascript
 - Kotlin
 - C#
